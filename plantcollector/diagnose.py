"""
What most likely happened in one comm fail, in plain words, from everything the session saw around it:
the pings of the SAU and the master, our own reads of the master, and - when the capture runs - the SAU's
Modbus answers to the master, its TCP acknowledgements, resets, and who else was talking to it at that moment.

Each rule says only what the evidence shows; where the evidence is missing (no mirror) it says so.
